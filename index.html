  <h1 style="text-align:center">IPL 2021: Ranking all 8 teams based on Indian players’ strength
</h1>
On May 4, the 2021 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) got suspended abruptly after multiple players and staff members contracted the COVID-19 virus. Now, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) faces the hefty task of conducting the remaining 31 games in a jam-packed cricket calendar.<br>Although the schedule and dates are yet to come, it is confirmed that the remainder of the competition will take place in the United Arab Emirates. As mentioned above, many important international fixtures are lined up this year, including the ICC T20 World Cup 2021.<br>Hence, all the cricket boards would want their players to remain fit and not drain themselves in the IPL. On top of that, the travel and isolation protocols might also keep foreign stars out of marquee tournaments. These factors have put the participation of overseas cricketers in jeopardy when the tournament resumes.<br>Furthermore, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has confirmed that the contracted England players will not feature in the remaining season. Australia’s Pat Cummins is another star who’ll give a miss to the tournament.<br>As the competition approaches, many more players are expected to pull out. Hence, the strength of the Indian contingent of all sides might determine the fate of the tournament.
